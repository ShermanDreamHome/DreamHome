    <p>Welcome! Thanks for stopping by. My name is Sherma'n Wilson and I've created this site as an additional
     resource for anyone searching for a home! Once you register for an account, you'll have the ability
    to create listings on your profile page to keep track of through your home searching journey. Once
    you create your listing you can always go back and edit them. You can make edits to your profile as well!
    You can add an image of the home you see for visual reference as well so you don't forget! This site can be
    a handy tool for anyone that enjoys making lists or who likes to stay organized in their research!</p>

    <div class="text-center"> <a href="/register">Well what are you waiting for? Register now to get started!</a></div>
